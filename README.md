# PRIMM: Searching and Sorting

In this PRIMM activity, you'll learn about classic searching and sorting algorithms. The methods contained in the SearchSort class are all static and illustrate the classic algorithms, which you should know.

Use this document as a place to document your answers to the questions. You won't turn this document in, but it can help supplement your notes.

## Predict
Answer the following prediction questions.

1. What will the program output when run?
    > your answer
2. Identify which methods are searching methods.
    >  your answer
3. What is the input and output to a search method?
    > your answer
4. Identify which methods are sorting methods.
    >  your answer
5. What is the input and output to a sort method?
    > your answer
6. Which is the most effiecient search method? Explain why.
    > your answer
7. Which is the most efficient sort method? Explain why.
    > your answer

## Investigate
Complete the JavaDoc for each of the methods. The description is super critical. Make sure that you indicate how the algorithm does its work. If you know the name of the algorithm, give it.

## Modify
In the runner class, add code that will test `mystery2` as well as code that will test `mystery4`,and `mystery5`. How will you make sure that the sorting algorithms get unsorted data?

One of sorting methods is slightly broken. Figure out which it is and fix it.

## Make
Pick one search and one sort method. Overload them to operate on an ArrayList. Add testing code to the runner class.
